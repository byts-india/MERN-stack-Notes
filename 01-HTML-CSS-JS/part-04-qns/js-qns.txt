## 1️⃣ JavaScript Basics (Must-Know)

1. What is JavaScript?
  Javascript is a scripting lang.
  It is used to build a dynmaic web page.

2. Is JavaScript interpreted or compiled?
  - JavaScript is best described as a just-in-time (JIT) compiled language, meaning it uses a hybrid approach of both interpretation and compilation

3. Difference between JavaScript and Java?
  - Js
    - interpreted
    - it is used majorly in web-dev.
    - scripting lang.
    - dynamic typed lang
  - java
    - compiled
    - strictly typed lang

4. Where can we write JavaScript code?
  - inside <script> tag
  - outside seperate .js file.

5. What are data types in JavaScript?
  - number
  - string
  - boolean
  - undefined
  - Symbol
  - BigInt
  - array
  - object

6. Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
7. What is `undefined`?
  - undefined is type, which is stored in all variable by default.
  - eg:
    let a;
    console.log(a); // undefined.

8. What is `null`?
  - null is of type object.
  - inside object, if you to tell it is nothing then use null over undefined.
  eg:
    let info = {
      name: null,
      age: 12
    };

9. Difference between `==` and `===`?
  eg:
    console.log( 10 == '10' );    // true
    console.log( 10 === '10' );   // false

10. What is type coercion? 
 - automatic conversion of one data type into another by js 
  during operations.
 - js is loosly typed.
 - implicit and explicit coercion

 eg: "5" + 2
      52

11. What is `NaN`?
 - NaN is a number type.
 - which tell `Not A Number`

12. How to check data type in JavaScript?
  - using typeof keyword.

13. What is `typeof null`?
  - give object.

14. What is hoisting?
  - a process of moving all declaration to top is called hoisting.
  eg:
    console.log(a);

    var a = 10;

15. Is JavaScript case-sensitive?
  - yes it is case sensitive.

## 2️⃣ Functions & Scope (Very Frequently Asked)

16. What is a function?
  - function is a concept. where reusable codes are kept.
  - so that we can call it when ever we want. 

17. Types of functions in JavaScript?
  - normal function
  - function expression
  - arrow function

18. What is function hoisting?
  - keeping function declartion at bottom of file.
  - as process of moving all declaration to top by js, is called hoisting.
  - func call is still valid.

19. What is scope in JavaScript?
  - scope reference the access and availability of a variable or func 
    in a context is called scope.

20. Types of scope?
  - local or block scope
  - function scope
  - global scope

21. What is global scope?
  - a variable or func defined outside. 
  - which accessible from anywhere.

22. What is local scope?
  - it is block level scope
  eg:
    for(let i=0; i<2; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  - this variable i is not access outside the for loop.
  - so variable i is local scope

23. Difference between function scope and block scope?
  - declared and accessible within the function is called function scope.
  - declared and accessible within the block is called block scope.

24. What is closure?
  - is created when a function remembers and accesses variables from
    it outer ( parent ) scope. even after the outer function has 
    finished it execution.

    function + its lexical scope = closure 

25. Why closures are used?
  - data hiding ( private variables )
  - maintain state btw functions calls
  - callbacks & async operations.
  - etc.

26. What is callback function?
  - is a function passed to another function.
  - which will be called later is called callback function
  eg:
    setTimeout(() => { console.log("called me."); }, 2000);
    here `() => {console.log("called me."); }` is a callback func.


27. What is IIFE?
  - Immediately invoked function execution

  (() => {
    console.log("hello");
  })();

## 3️⃣ Arrays & Objects (CTS Favorite)

28. How to create an array?
  eg:
    let arr = [10,20,30];

29. Common array methods?
  eg:
    .push()
    .map()
    .forEach()
    .find()
    .findIndex()
    .reverse()
    .sort()

30. Difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?
  - map()
    - will map a logic to all its items
    - return same size of items as given
  - filter()
    - will filter items based on logic
    - return same size or lesser no of items given
  - reduce()
    - give as single value.
    - mostly used for sum, product of elements.

31. Difference between `forEach()` and `map()`?
    - In forEach() won't return any value.
    - map() will return values.]

32. What is `push()` vs `pop()`?
  - arr.push()    : add elements at last / right
  - arr.pop()     : remove elements at last / right

33. What is `shift()` and `unshift()`?
  - arr.unshift()    : add elements at first / left
  - arr.shift()     : remove elements at first / left

34. How to remove duplicates from an array?
    let arr = [100 , 200,  200, 300, 400];

    let new_arr = []

    for(x of  new Set(arr)){
        new_arr.push(x);
    }

    console.log(new_arr);

35. What is an object?
  - object is a data type in js.
  - where mostly it store as key value pair.

36. How to access object properties?
  - we can access in two ways. 
  - using . operator
  - using [] 
  eg:
    obj = {
      name: "ace",
      age: 33
    };
    console.log( obj.name );
    console.log( obj['name'] );

37. Difference between dot and bracket notation?
  - dot notation:
    - eg: obj.name 
    - here key should not be seperated with space. 
  - bracket notation
    - eg: obj["name"]
    - here key can be seperated with spaces.

38. What is destructuring?
  - removing from structure .
  - array destructuring
    eg:  arr = [...[10,20], ...[30,40]];
  - object destructuring
    eg:  obj = {...{a:10,b:20}};

39. What is spread operator?
  - ... three dots is called spread operator.
  - it is named on where we are using this operator.
  - eg:  arr = [...[10,20], ...[30,40]];

40. What is rest operator?
  const [a, ...b] = [...[10,20], ...[30,40]];

## 4️⃣ Strings & Numbers

41. Common string methods?
  .split()
  .replace()
  .toLowerCase()
  .toUpperCase()
  .charAt()

42. Difference between `slice()` and `substring()`?
  - slice()
    - can accept neg indexs
    - more flexible
    - works with string & arrays
  - substring()
    - does not support neg indexes
    - auto swap start and end. if start > end
    - works only with string.

43. How to reverse a string?
  let arr = "abcde".split('');
  arr.reverse()
  s = arr.join("")
  console.log(s);

44. How to check palindrome?
  let val = "madam";
  n = val.length

  flag = true;

  for(let i=0; i<n/2; i++) {
      if (val[i] != val[n-i-1]) {
          flag = false;
      }
  }

  console.log(flag ? 'palindrome' : 'not a palindrome');

45. How to convert string to number?
    - Number('123');
    - parseInt('123')
46. Difference between `parseInt()` and `Number()`?
  - both are used to convert string to number.
  - parseInt() stops cconversion when it hits a non numeric char
  - Number() if non numeric found, it stores NaN.

47. What is `toFixed()`?
  - used to format a number to a fixed number of decimal places.

    - fast
    - simple
    - return single element
  - querySelector()
