Middleware in Express.js refers to functions that execute during the request-response cycle. These functions have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the next middleware function (`next`). Middleware can modify the request and response objects, execute code, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.

### Types of Middleware in Express:

1. **Application-Level Middleware**: Used across the entire application using `app.use()`.
2. **Router-Level Middleware**: Applied to specific routes using `express.Router()`.
3. **Error-Handling Middleware**: Handles errors using four parameters `(err, req, res, next)`.
4. **Built-in Middleware**: Provided by Express, such as `express.json()` and `express.static()`.
5. **Third-Party Middleware**: External middleware like `morgan` for logging or `cors` for handling cross-origin requests.

### Example of Middleware in Express:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Application-level middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, URL: ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Route handler
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

Middleware is a powerful feature in Express that helps structure applications efficiently. You can learn more about it [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) or [here](https://www.w3schools.in/express-js/middleware). Would you like examples of specific middleware types?
